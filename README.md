# Description

Run scripts on network state changes

# Install

    pip install connman-dispatcher [--user]


# Usage

    $ connman-dispatcher -h
    usage: connman-dispatcher [-h] -p PATH

Scripts are run from folders setted in -p argument.

One can set more than one folder.

When network state changes, each script is executed with either `up` or `down`
argument, depening on the current network state.

For example, if connman-dispatcher was run like this:

    connman-dispatcher -p /etc/connman-dispatcher

And we have some scripts in bash in this folder, something like:

```bash
up() {
# handle up state
}

down() {
# handle down state
}

state="$1"

case $state in
    up)
        up
        ;;
    down)
        down
        ;;
esac
```

When network state changes from `down` to `up`, each script in `/etc/connman-dispatcher`
will be executed with `up` argument, like this:

    /etc/connman-dispatcher/10_handle_network_state_change.sh up
    /etc/connman-dispatcher/some_other_executable up


Scripts, as well as script folders are sorted by name.
